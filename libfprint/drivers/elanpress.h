 * These sensors stream raw frames like the swipe sensors handled by the
 * elan driver, but the finger rests on the sensor instead of being swiped
 * across it. The imaged area is far too small for reliable minutiae
 * matching, so enrollment stores the images themselves and matching is
 * done by normalized cross-correlation, like the Windows driver does.
